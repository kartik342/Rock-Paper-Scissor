# Rock Paper Scissors Game 🎮✊📄✂️

A responsive and interactive Rock Paper Scissors game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The user can select rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly picks a move. The scores are updated in real-time, and the result is displayed with styled messages.

Built a full-stack Blog App using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS — features user
authentication (login, logout, registration), and allows users to create, edit, like, and delete
posts. Implemented JWT-based auth and dynamic EJS templating to render personalized
user dashboards and post interactions.
